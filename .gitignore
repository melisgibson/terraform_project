# This .gitignore is for my course specifically. Keep in mind, you would also want to ignore 
# .tfvars and ALL security keys in production. Those are here only for the benefit of the course and are not in use.

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sentitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.
#
#Some lessons require a tfvars files, so I have ommitted this entry. You should always ignore .tfvars in production.
